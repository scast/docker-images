A development base image using Ubuntu 14.04.

Uses phusion/base-image.

Includes:

- Common development tools like git, build-essential, man pages, tig, ...
- Development headers (to build drivers) for MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Decent tmux and zsh config.
- Common utilities I use for development (python, ruby, sass, ...)
